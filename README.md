Climate change is undoubtedly one of the biggest problems in the 21st century. Artificial Intelligence methods have recently contributed in the advancement of accurate prediction tools for the estimation and assessment of extreme environmental events and investigation of the climate change time series. The recent advancement in Artificial Intelligence including the novel machine learning and deep learning algorithms as well as soft computing applications have greatly empowered prediction methods. Through this project, I have explore, analyze the global Climatic trend and pattern on temperature component and forecast the future temperature trends using a state of art time series deep learning model. After the research, exploration and analysis on the historical data and modelling, we build and deploy an end to end web solution on the frontend to view and explore historical data as well as future forecasts generated through the deep learning model.
