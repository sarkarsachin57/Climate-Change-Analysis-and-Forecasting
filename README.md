Climate change is undoubtedly one of the biggest problems in the 21st century. Artificial Intelligence methods have recently contributed in the advancement of accurate prediction tools for the estimation and assessment of extreme environmental events and investigation of the climate change time series. The recent advancement in Artificial Intelligence including the novel machine learning and deep learning algorithms as well as soft computing applications have greatly empowered prediction methods. Through this project, I have explore, analyze the global Climatic trend and pattern on temperature component and forecast the future temperature trends using a state of art time series deep learning model. After the research, exploration and analysis on the historical data and modelling, we build and deploy an end to end web solution on the frontend to view and explore historical data as well as future forecasts generated through the deep learning model.

### About Data :

For this project we used 3 csv file and 1 json. This are – <br><br>
**GlobalTemperatures.csv :** For global average land temperatures.<br>
**GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv :** For average temperatures group by countries.<br>
**GlobalLandTemperaturesByState.csv :** For average temperatures group by states.<br>
**Countries.geo.json :** Fo geographical locations of countries.<br><br>
The csv data was collected from http://berkeleyearth.org/data/<br><br><br>

### Web Application :

Multi paged web based solution developed using streamlit to show plots, analysis and forecasts.
Here 5 different web pages developed inside the application. This are – <br><br>
•	Documentation<br>
•	Historical Data and Plotting<br>
•	Future Data and Plotting<br>
•	Feedback Us<br>
•	About Us<br>
